### Vertex Painting

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="35%" valign="top" text-align="left">The hammer uses two scripts, Crusher.cs and Crushable.cs.<br><br>
Adding the Crusher script to a GameObject allows it to crush, and the Crushable script allows it to be crushed by the Crusher. <br><br> I had many versions of this, at first the object got knocked away from being hit by the hammer, but that only caused frustration as things got out of reach, so I settled for a trigger collision instead. <br><br> The particle effect looks at the material color of crushable object to match the color.</td>
